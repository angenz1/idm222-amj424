            The Amish Project, directed by John Gancar, is a fictional
            exploration of the 2006 Nickel Mines schoolhouse shooting in
            Lancaster Pennsylvania. It explores the Amish community and the path
            of forgiveness and compassion forged in its wake. The play, which
            was first produced at the New York International Fringe Festival in
            2008, was originally performed by the author as a solo piece. The
            WCR will be producing the ensemble edition with eight well-known and
            talented local actors. The Amish Project is presented by special
            arrangement with Samuel French Inc, a Concord Theatricals Company.
            Masks required.

            Artist Rebecca Ross has lived and worked in the Reading area for the
            past 28 years. She is a studio artist at GoggleWorks Center for the
            Arts. For the past three years, her artwork has focused on musical
            performances in the Reading area. Rebecca is an expressionistic
            colorist. The challenge of the series has been making figurative
            sketches on-site and further refining them into detailed, full-color
            paintings and drawings. Many works are based on performances at
            Reading's Jazz Fest and Blues Fest. Masks required.

          <h3>My Mother's Refrigerator An Art Show hosted by Barrio Alegría</h3>
          <p>Date: Friday, December 17, 2021</p>
          <p>Time: 6:00 - 8:00PM</p>
          <p>
            The My Mother's Refrigerator art show was designed to create
            exhibition opportunities for up-and-coming local artists who have
            never shown work at an established art institution. It is also a way
            to connect up-and-coming artists with community members. This event
            was designed for folks who have never participated in a gallery show
            before, but it is also for community members who are looking to
            support artists by purchasing art. Everybody's art makes it to My
            Mother's Refrigerator! If you love to do art and want to show it,
            network, meet new people, and have your art purchased by someone
            from our community, then this is the show to be a part of! For more
