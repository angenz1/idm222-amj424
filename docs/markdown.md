### History

Steeped in a vibrant history, the WCR Center for the Arts was erected in the 19th century in the Callowhill District of Reading, on the site of the city’s first post office. After serving as the Wyomissing Club for many years, the building became home to the Women’s Club of Reading in 1919. In the summer of 2004, several community leaders came together to form a new entity, the WCR Center for the Arts. The organization was formed for the purpose of preserving this historic building as a unique performance and exhibition venue for the community. At the center of this stately building is a 265-seat auditorium with an acoustical quality unmatched anywhere in southeastern Pennsylvania. A superb vintage Steinway grand piano, purchased by the Woman’s Club, is still showcased in concerts today. The venue also boasts a gallery and reception hall, perfect for exhibits, meetings and various entertainment events.

### Mission

WCR Center for the Arts is a nonprofit community organization focused on promoting the arts, serving the community, and enhancing the revitalization efforts in Reading, Pennsylvania. Our primary goal is to preserve the facility to serve the Reading community as it has done for over 150 years.

“There are some places one plays where you feel like the music is going directly from you to the people in the audience — not just to their ears, but right into their souls. The Woman’s Club is such a place. It feels like you are having an intimate conversa- tion with everyone in the room. It is rare and it is exciting and it needs to be preserved.”

— Michael Kannen, cellist
Director of Chamber Music
The Peabody Conservatory
