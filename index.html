      <h2>History</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>
        Steeped in a vibrant history, the WCR Center for the Arts was erected in
        the 19th century in the Callowhill District of Reading, on the site of
        the city’s first post office. After serving as the Wyomissing Club for
        many years, the building became home to the Women’s Club of Reading in
        1919. In the summer of 2004, several community leaders came together to
        form a new entity, the WCR Center for the Arts. The organization was
        formed for the purpose of preserving this historic building as a unique
        performance and exhibition venue for the community. At the center of
        this stately building is a 265-seat auditorium with an acoustical
        quality unmatched anywhere in southeastern Pennsylvania. A superb
        vintage Steinway grand piano, purchased by the Woman’s Club, is still
        showcased in concerts today. The venue also boasts a gallery and
        reception hall, perfect for exhibits, meetings and various entertainment
        events.

    <section>
      <p>

        promoting the arts, serving the community, and enhancing the
        revitalization efforts in Reading, Pennsylvania. Our primary goal is to

        over 150 years.

        “There are some places one plays where you feel like the music is going
        directly from you to the people in the audience — not just to their
        ears, but right into their souls. The Woman’s Club is such a place. It
        feels like you are having an intimate conversation with everyone in the
        room. It is rare and it is exciting and it needs to be preserved.”
